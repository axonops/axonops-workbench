## Download and install

Browse to the [releases](https://github.com/axonops/axonops-workbench/releases) and select the package for your Operating System. We prebuild distributions for

- OSX (Intel and Apple chips)
- Linux (RedHat, Debian and others)
- Windows (Intel)

For MacOS it is also possible to install the AxonOps Workbench using [brew](https://brew.sh/)

```sh
# Optional: set applications directory to your $HOME
export HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS="--appdir=~/Applications"
brew tap axonops/homebrew-repository
brew install --cask axonopsworkbench
```

If you'd like to use a `beta` release use instead

```sh
brew install --cask axonopsworkbench-beta
```

and for the daily internal builds (used for testing and development purposes) use

```sh
brew install --cask axonopsworkbench-internal
```

## Tidying up between beta release installs

The current builds are still in development and are not necessarily backwards compatible, so do this before taking a new beta release

### Linux and macOS:

- Delete the folder(s) with perfix .axonops- in the home folder.
- In the OS Keychain, remove all keys with prefix AxonOps.

### Windows:
- Delete the folder with prefix axonops- in the user directory folder C:\Users{username}.
- Delete the folder with prefix AxonOps in apps' data folder C:\Users{username}\AppData\Roaming or %appData%.
- In the Windows Credential Manager, remove all credentials with prefix AxonOps.
- In the registries - using the regedit tool -, navigate to Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\AxonOpsWorkbenchClustersSecrets - it can also be AxonOpsDeveloperWorkbenchClustersSecrets -, delete the entire key/folder.
